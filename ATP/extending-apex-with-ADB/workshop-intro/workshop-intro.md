# Introduction

## Oracle Application Express and Oracle Autonomous Database

In this workshop, you'll get first-hand experience of using Oracle Autonomous Database (ADB) and Oracle Application Express (APEX). Oracle Autonomous Database (ADB) delivers a self-driving, self-securing, self-repairing database service that can instantly scale to meet demands. The service supports two workload types:

* Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) provides an autonomous warehousing environment, associated with fast query performance.
* Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP) provides an autonomous online transaction processing and mixed workload environment.

APEX is a low-code development platform that enables you to build scalable, secure enterprise apps, with world-class features, that can be deployed anywhere.

### Objectives
In this workshop you'll learn how to provision an ATP instance and create an APEX workspace and APEX application, and then add the following features to your APEX application:

* Geospatial functionality
* Machine learning
* Security
