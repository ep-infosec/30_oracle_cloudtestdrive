# Autonomous Transaction Processing for Developers #

## Initial Steps to Connect to the Database

### Introduction ###

This section of the lab is for people who did not yet execute the base Autonomous Database lab, but want to discover how to connect to this database before deploying an application in this environment.


### Prerequisites ###

- This lab requires you to install a VNC viewer on your Laptop so that you can complete this hands-on lab.   There are many VNC viewer packages both commercial and open source. 

  - For **macOS** we advise realVNC which can be obtained from 

    - https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/macos/

  - For **Windows**, suggested packages are TigerVNC viewer or TightVNC Viewer but if you already have a preferred VNC viewer you can use this. TigerVNC viewer has a simpler install process, as it is a standalone executable, but has fewer features.

    - TigerVNC: Download ‘vncviewer64-1.9.0.exe’ from

      - https://bintray.com/tigervnc/stable/tigervnc/1.9.0#files and save it to your desktop. It is a self-contained executable file, which requires no further installation.

    - TightVNC Viewer: Select the 'Installer for Windows (64-bit)' from

      - https://www.tightvnc.com/download.php

        When prompted, select to save the file.  Next, run the executable to install the program. This requires you have the privileges to install software on your machine
