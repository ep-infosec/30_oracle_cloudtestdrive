# Application Development Infrastructure Lab #

## Setting up a Cloud Infrastructure to run your applications ##

### Prerequisites ###
To run these labs you will need access to an Oracle Cloud Account.  If you are participating in a live event, your instructor will provide you the required credentials.

If you are running these labs on your own, please get a [Trial account](https://myservices.us.oraclecloud.com/mycloud/signup?sourceType=:ex:tb:::RC_EMMK181016P00010:Virtual_WS_DEV&SC=:ex:tb:::RC_EMMK181016P00010:Virtual_WS_DEV&pcode=EMMK181016P00010) or set up your corporate UC subscription for this lab.


### Introduction ###

This lab will showcase how to use the Oracle Cloud to run your applications, using the traditional Oracle components such as the Oracle Database and the WebLogic application Server.  

We'll spin up these components using the PaaS Cloud Control GUI, and then take a look at the underlying infrastructure elements that were created via these wizard-driven installers.

+ Step 1 : [Create a new Oracle Database instance via the GUI](dbcs-create/README.md).  In case you are using a demo account provided during an event, you can skip this step and use the seeded database service that is already available.
+ Step 2 : [Create a Java Cloud Service Instance using the Cloud user interface](jcs-create/README.md)
