You are welcome to a live workshop hosted by Oracle in collaboration with OQVA, that will shade light on how to use Oracle managed Kubernetes with the cutting edge GitOps approach.

GitOps is a new paradigm of implementing CD (continuous delivery) for cloud-native applications. This approach focuses on operating cloud infrastructure using tools that developers are already familiar with.



## Before you begin, here are some prerequisite: ##


1. GitHub account, if you already have a GitHub account you can skip this step,
if not please create one here: https://github.com/join

2. Make sure you have an Oracle OCI account.

If you don't have a cloud account yet, you can request  an Oracle Cloud Free Tier via [this link](https://bit.ly/ocicredits)

```diff 
For Existing Accounts only :
