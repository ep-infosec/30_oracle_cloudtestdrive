# Part 2 - Provision Flux # 

In this part we are going to install and provision Flux. 

Flux is a tool that automatically ensures that the state of a cluster matches the config in git. It uses an operator in the cluster to trigger deployments inside Kubernetes, which means you don't need a separate CD tool. It monitors all relevant image repositories, detects new images, triggers deployments and updates the desired running configuration based on that (and a configurable policy).

Source: https://github.com/fluxcd/flux

We are going to implement this operation using CloudShell in the cloud console, 
but alternatively if you have a developer machine that has access to OCI, you can do it from there. 

1.	Install Flux cli run the following command: 
```
curl -s https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/install.sh | bash -s $PWD
```

output:

```


2.	Install Flux controllers on your OKE cluster (Before installing, it may fail if your worker nodes are not up and running. Usually you need to wait 5~10 minutes, 
until your Kubernetes cluster is fully provisioned, and the node pool is ready - if it continues to fail, check your nodes status from the cloud console: Develeoper Services > Kubernetes Clusters) 
```
./flux install 
```

output: 
```
✚ generating manifests
✔ manifests build completed
► installing components in flux-system namespace
✔ install completed
◎ verifying installation
✔ source-controller ready
✔ kustomize-controller ready
✔ helm-controller ready
✔ notification-controller ready
✔ install finished
```

3.	Verify that Flux is installed in your Cluster, let's verify that the pods are in ready state. 
```
kubectl get pod -n flux-system
``` 

output:
```
NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
helm-controller-c65c64b89-lvlmr           1/1     Running   0          2m59s
kustomize-controller-77789fd79f-bvrz6     1/1     Running   0          2m59s
notification-controller-7c8779c44-9k6kr   1/1     Running   0          2m59s
source-controller-6bb5dc558c-nj2vz        1/1     Running   0          2m59s
```
4.	Now Observe flux custom resources
```
kubectl get crds -A
```

output:
```
NAME                                         CREATED AT

```

Well done, Flux is provisioned.
