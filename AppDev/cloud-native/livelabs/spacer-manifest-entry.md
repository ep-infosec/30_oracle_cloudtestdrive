# Opps, this is the labs version of a 404 page

Hi There, it seems that you clicked on a lab menu entry that was intended to be a separator, but it bought you here, I'm sorry about that, but at least you're getting an explanation than just a blank page.

I know it's frustrating but it's a missing feature in the live labs processing engine, and I've requested that we have the ability to have separators which you can't click on, hopefully they will come soon.

Thanks, Tim Graves (Lab creator)
