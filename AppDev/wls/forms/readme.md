# Forms on OCI with Universal Credits 



## Summary

This tutorial proposes an automation to create a Forms environment using the WLS for OCI Suite UCM Marketplace stack.  This allows you to spin up a new Forms environment, without a need to purchase classic licenses, since the WLS for OCI Suite offers you the entitlement to run Oracle Forms, and pay per use - per OCPU and per hour.

We'll be using the standard WLS for OCI Marketplace Stack terraform script, and ammend it to include the creation of a Forms installation on each WLS node.
