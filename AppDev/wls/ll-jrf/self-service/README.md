# WebLogic for OCI (JRF) -  VM via Marketplace

This folder contains the lab for running WLS for OCI as a VM, using the JRF install type.

This subversion of the page is specifically set up for the self-service version of the lab via oracle.com



- Best way to experience this lab : use the [LiveLab Webpage](https://oracle.github.io/cloudtestdrive/AppDev/wls/ll-jrf/self-service/) visualization



Alternatively, you can visit the normal GitHub .md files of the lab in this folder:

- [Introduction](../wlsforocijrf_intro.md)
- [Prepare your tenancy for the lab](../wlsforocijrf_prereq.md): create a compartment, a vault with secrets, and an Autonomous database
- [Instance Creation](../wlsforocijrf.md): create a WebLogic instance, customize the Loadbalancer, and deploy an ADF application
- [Optional steps](../wlsforocijrfopt.md): deploy a more complex ADF application, and destroy the resources you created in the lab
