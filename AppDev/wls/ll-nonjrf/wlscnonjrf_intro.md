# WebLogic for OCI - Introduction



## Objective

This lab will guide you through the steps to create a WebLogic for OCI Instance, more specifically using the *Virtual Machine* flavor, and using the non-JRF option (so no database required).

- If you are running this lab on a personal **free tier** account, you will need to do some initial setup in order to prepare your tenancy for this lab.  These steps are described in the first chapter of this lab, called **WebLogic for OCI as a VM - Prerequisites**.  You can obtain a **free tier** account via [this link](https://signup.oraclecloud.com/).
- The actual creation of the WLS instance is described in the second chapter of this lab, called **WebLogic for OCI as a VM**.  Once the WLS instance is up and running, you can access the management console and deploy a test application.  In case you are running this lab on a shared instance, your instructor will provide you with the required information to be able to start this part immediately.



## 1. Overview of the WebLogic for OCI - VM flavor

In this lab we will spin up a simple configuration of WebLogic, composed of the following elements :

We will be using the "WebLogic for OCI" Marketplace to select an image with the following properties:

- Running as a Virtual Machine on the Infrastructure
- Using the EE edition of WebLogic
- Using the **UCM** or **Universal Credits Model** license model

Much more sophisticated setups are possible, you can explore thes on your own adfter the initial lab :

- Using a Repository database
- Using an existing network setup corresponding to your specific needs

Below an example of a setup with private networks and a Database:
