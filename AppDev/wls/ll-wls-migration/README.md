# WebLogic Migration Tooling

This folder contains the lab giving you hands-on experience of the tools needed to migrate WebLogic environments: WebLogic Deployment Tool and Image Tool.



This lab is composed of the following steps : 



- **[Prerequisites](test_wls_docker_image-stack/Readme.md)** : you will create a compute instance where we will spin up 2 WebLogic environments, so we can use these environments to execute the migration.  



- **[Part 1 : Using the WDT tool](WLS_deploy_scripts/README.md)** to migrate a WebLogic domain from a source to a target server.



- **[Part 2 : Image Toolkit](WLS_imagetool_scripts/README.md)** : creating docker images with WebLogic software, patch these distribution with the latest PSU, and deploy Weblogic Domains and you will store them to Oracle OCI Registry.

  



You can find extra information to help you during the execution of the steps of your labs in the [Troubleshooting](troublshooting.md) section
