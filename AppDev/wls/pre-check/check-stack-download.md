# WebLogic for OCI - pre-lab check



## Objective

This page allows you to check the ability to work with Oracle cloud and the Marketplace Stack mechanism.

In some exceptional cases we have noted that very **restictive corporate firewalls or VPN settings** might stop you from correctly working with the WebLogic for OCI marketplace solution.  

You can use the below steps to quickly check if your corporate environment is correctly configured, for example as a preparation to a hands-on lab that will be executed.

It is important to use a **configuration that is representative** of what the majority of participants will be using, especially with respect to any constraints on use of VPN, firewalls or browser plug-ins that might be standard in your environment.



## 1. Log in to an Oracle OCI tenancy

- You can obtain a **free tier** account via [this link](https://signup.oraclecloud.com/).



- Open the console of your cloud tenancy via https://www.oracle.com/cloud/sign-in.html and login to your tenancy

  - **Cloud Account Name** : this is the name of your tenancy, not your username!
