# Creating a VM for running microservices



## Objective

This chapter will go through the process of creating a Virtual Compute environment to run your microservices

## Step 1 - Creating the VM Instance

- Navigate to the Compute Instance page to launch a new virtual machine where we will run the microservice application

  ![image-20211021160051168](images/image-20211021160051168.png)

- Use the **Create instance** button to launch the wizard

- Enter a name for the VM, for example *myVM*

- Keep the default AD selection (in this case there are 3 AD's available, with AD 1 selected)

  ![image-20211021160259577](images/image-20211021160259577.png)

- Use the **Change Image** button to select the image called **Oracle Linux Cloud Developer** and don't forget to click the checkbox to accept the T&C.

- Keep the default  **Shape** proposed

  ![image-20211108173210296](images/image-20211108173210296.png)

  

- Select the Virtual network you created earlier, and make sure to be on the **public** subnet

- Also ensure the **Assign a public Iv4 address** option is selected

  ![image-20211021160614015](images/image-20211021160614015.png)

- Be sure to generate a public/private key pair, and **download both the public and private key** to your laptop.  You will need them to connect to your machine in a minute.

- Leave the **Boot volume** parameters as per the defaults

  ![image-20211021160733195](images/image-20211021160733195.png)

The VM is now being generated, wait for the status to pass from **Provisioning** to **Running**

![image-20211021161038664](images/image-20211021161038664.png)

and a minute later : 

![image-20211021161144655](images/image-20211021161144655.png)

- Note the **Public IP Address** of your instance, you will need it to connect to your instance.

## Step 2 - Setting up the VM Instance

- Open the **Cloud Shell** of your console

  ![image-20211021161448356](images/image-20211021161448356.png)

- Now drag and drop the **private** key file you downloaded earier on the console.  This will upload the key to your cloud shell :

  ![image-20211021161640661](images/image-20211021161640661.png)

- While we are copying files, let's also copy the microservices source code files that are in the zip file you downladed earlier over to the cloudshelll environment: drag & drop the files **msapi.js** and **consumer.rb** onto the console.

- Set restrictive permissions on the key file as required by ssh 
  (replace the name with the name of **your** file)

  ```
  chmod 400 ssh-key-2021-10-21.key
  ```

- First copy the source code of the two Microservices from the console into the VM we just created, using the private key (replace the IP address with the public IP address of **your** instance, and the keyfile name with **your** keyfile name ! )

  ```
  scp -i ssh-key-2021-10-21.key msapi.js opc@152.70.161.144:msapi.js
  scp -i ssh-key-2021-10-21.key consumer.rb opc@152.70.161.144:consumer.rb
  ```

- Now ssh into your VM with the below command
  (replace the IP address with the public IP address of **your** instance, and the keyfile name with **your** keyfile name ! )

  ```
  ssh -i ssh-key-2021-10-21.key opc@152.70.161.144
  ```

- As this is a fresh Linux instance, we need to install a few components to get our microservices running

- Install Express with the following command :

  ```
  npm install express
  ```

  You will get some warnings, this is OK.

- Install the faraday gem for the Ruby microservice:

  ```
  gem install faraday
  ```

  

- You should now be able to launch your microservice with the following command:

  ```
  node msapi.js
  ```

  Resulting output:

## Step 3 - Network configuration

- Open a second console on your Virtual machine

  - Simply open a second browser window, and copy the URL of your first window into the 2nd browser window.  This will open a second cloud shell

  - Next re-issue the below ssh command to log into your virtual machine

    ```
    ssh -i ssh-key-2021-10-21.key opc@152.70.161.144
    ```

We now need to make sure we can access the port 9002 on which this service is listening is accesible from the internet : we need to add the port in the firewall rules of the Linux OS, and add a rule in the security list of the public virtual network.

- On the command line of the Virtual machine, add the port to the Linux firewall:

  ```
  sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=9002/tcp --permanent
  
  sudo firewall-cmd --reload
  ```

- In the cloud console, navigate to the virtual machine you created (via the menu **Compute** then **Instances**) and in the Overview screen click on the subnet of the instance:

  ![image-20211021204410542](images/image-20211021204410542.png)

- This will display the details of the subnet, where you need to click on the Default Security Rule for the subnet:  

  ![image-20211021204708577](images/image-20211021204708577.png)

- You now see the Ingress rules that are open by default - we need to add a rule to allow port 9002 to be accessed: click on **Add Ingress Rules**

  ![image-20211021204953228](images/image-20211021204953228.png)



Configure a rule to allow access from everywhere on ports 9002 and 443: 9002 for the microservice itself, and 443 for https access to a gateway we will configure later in the lab.

- Enter the source CIDR as 0.0.0.0/0

- Leave Source Port Range blank (all sources)

- Enter 9002,443 in destination port

- Click on the **Add Ingress Rules** button

  ![image-20211031185555341](images/image-20211031185555341.png)

Now verify access to your microservice by opening a new tab on your browser, and accessing the service using an URL that looks like the one below - you need to **replace the IP address** with the public IP address of your VM machine:

```
http://132.226.204.234:9002/med
```

This should return :

```
{}
```



## Step 4 - Configure an API Gateway for HTTPS access

Because an ATP database is only allowing external calls to HTTPS endpoints, we need to also configure a gateway in front of our microservice that listens on port 443 and re-routes the request to our service.

- Open the menu and select first **Developer Services**, then under API Management select **Gateways**

![](images/image-20211030150929234.png)



- Click the **Create Gateway** button

  ![](images/image-20211030151300173.png)

- Enter the following fields:

  - **Name** : the name of your gateway, for example **MyGW**
  - **Type** must be public
  - **Virtual Cloud Network** : select the VCN you created earlier
  - **Subnet**: select the **Public** subnet of your VCN
  - Leave all other fields untouched, and click the **Create Gateway** button

  ![image-20211030151525507](images/image-20211030151525507.png)

- Wait a few moments for the Gateway to become Active, then open the **Deployments** menu on the left

- Click the **Create Deployment** button, and fill in the parameters

- Select the **From Scratch** option

- **Name**: a name for your deployment, for example **myDepl**

- **Path Prefix**: enter **/ms**

- Leave all other parameters as is and click the **Next** button

- ![image-20211030152203989](images/image-20211030152203989.png)

Now we will configure a Route consistent with the path of your microservice.

- **Path**: /med

- **Methods** : PUT and GET

- **Type**: HTTP

- **URL** : replace the IP address with the public IP address of your VM machine

  ```
  http://132.226.204.234:9002/med
  ```

- Leave the other parameters as par default

  ![image-20211108113531293](images/image-20211108113531293.png)

- When finished adding the route, create the deployment by clicking the button **Next**, then **Create**.

After a few moments your deployment should be **Active**

- On the Gateway Information screen, locate the **Hostname** of your gateway and copy it over to your notebook for future use.  Use the **Show** button to display the name, or the **Copy** button to cut and paste it over to a notebook.

  ![image-20211030153623939](images/image-20211030153623939.png)

- Now test access to your microservice through the gateway: in a browser tab, access the following URL:

```
https://<your gateway hostname>/ms/med
```

For example: https://nkpqmf4umv3eyighkjhuenla.apigateway.eu-frankfurt-1.oci.customer-oci.com/ms/med

Again you should see an empty accolade as a return, with no errors displayed:

```
{}
```





You can now navigate to the next chapter of this lab !
