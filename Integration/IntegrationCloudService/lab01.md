# OIC Integration – for application integration

### JAM Workshop (Journey of App Modernization)
This hands-on, instructor-led workshop supplements live presentations and demos in order to cover both technical architecture and innovation use cases, strategies when taking application networks to the cloud and introduce you the tools required for successful implementation.
No expertise or previous experience is required.

This set of labs covers the following Oracle Integration Services –
-	Apiary – for API Design
-	API Platform CS – for API Management
-	OIC Integration – for application integration
-	OIC Integration – for process automation and low-code apps extension



## Objective

The use case is very simple – we need to be able to expose an API that allows us to create new organizations in Oracle Service Cloud (fka. Right Now).

Contents
-	Oracle Integration Cloud Overview
-	Create the Connections - REST and Service Cloud
-	Create the Integration
-	Activate the Integration
-	Test using Postman

## **STEP 1:** Oracle Integration Cloud Overview

-	Login to Oracle Integration Cloud (OIC)

![](images/lab01/img0010.png)

Think of OIC as a toolbox, containing the following –

-	Integrations – to connect applications
-	Processes – to extend applications or create new custom business processes
-	Visual Builder – to create new applications in a low-code environment

-	Click on **Integrations**
    * This brings us into the Integration IDE.

  ![](images/lab01/img0020.png)

The Integration Designer allows us to do the following –
-	Create Connections to applications
-	Create Integrations, leveraging those Connections
-	Add Lookups to do domain value mapping
    * Eg. the state of California is known as CA in one app, while in the other, it is the full name
-	Package those Integrations into functional units
-	Agents – create connectivity agents for secure communication with on-premise apps
-	Adapters – Connections leverage adapters – see what you get out of the box with OIC.
-	Enhance your integrations with JavaScript libraries


## **STEP 2.1:** Create the Connections - REST

We will create a REST Connection which will trigger our integration, and a Service Cloud connection to communicate with, you&#39;ve guessed it, Oracle Service Cloud.

-	Click on **Connections**

![](images/lab01/img0030.png)

-	Click **Create**

![](images/lab01/img0040.png)

-	Search for the **REST** adapter

![](images/lab01/img0050.png)

![](images/lab01/img0060.png)

-	Configure as follows
    * **Name**: REST-Trigger-**NN** (Replace **NN** with the number given by your trainers. Do so for all examples in this lab.)
    ![](images/lab01/img0070.png)

-	Click **Test, Save** , in that order.

![](images/lab01/img0080.png)

-	Then **Close** the Connection configuration:

![](images/lab01/img0085.png)

-	The REST connection should list as *Configured*:

![](images/lab01/img0090.png)



## **STEP 2.2:** Create the Connections - Service Cloud

-	Now **Create** the Service Cloud Connection, you can search to filter away the other adapters.

![](images/lab01/img0100.png)

![](images/lab01/img0110.png)

-	**Configure** as follows
    * **Name**: ServiceCloud-**NN**
    ![](images/lab01/img0120.png)

-	**Configure** with the following WSDL URL :
    ```
	https://rnowgse00581.rightnowdemo.com/services/soap/connect/soap?wsdl
    ```

    * Under **Connection Properties**, **Enter** the **WSDL URL**:
    ![](images/lab01/img0140.png)

    * In **Security** section:
        +	**Username** : Admin1
        +	**Password**: Your trainers will provide this to you
        ![](images/lab01/img0150.png)

-	Click **Test, Save** , in that order, and **Close** the Connection configuration. 

You should now be able to see your new connection at the top of the list.

![](images/lab01/img0160.png)



## **STEP 3.1:** Create the Integration - Create App Driven Orchestration

-	Open the main menu and click on **Integrations**

![](images/lab01/img0170.png)

-	Click **Create**

![](images/lab01/img0180.png)

-	Select **App Driven Orchestration**

![](images/lab01/img0190.png)

-	**Configure** as follows
    * **Name**: CreateServiceOrg-**NN**
    * **Description**: Your name or initials
    * **Package**: pck-createServiceOrg-**NN**

-	Click **Create**

![](images/lab01/img0200.png)


## **STEP 3.2:** Create the Integration - Configure REST Trigger

-	Click on the start node, **search for** and **select your REST Connection**: REST-Trigger-NN

![](images/lab01/img0210.png)

-	**Configure** the REST-Trigger as follows
    * Name: CreateOrgService
    * Description: Your name or initials
    * Multiple resources or verbs: not checked (leave default)

![](images/lab01/img0215.png)
    
-	Click **Next**
   
    * Endpoint&#39;s relative resource URI: /createOrg
    * Action to perform on endpoint: POST
    * Make sure &quot;_Configure a request payload for this endpoint_&quot; and &quot;_Configure this endpoint to receive the response_&quot; are **selected**
    
-	Click **Next**

![](images/lab01/img0220.png)

-	In the Request-step:
    *	**Select JSON** as payload sample
    ![](images/lab01/img0230.png)

    *	**Click** &lt;&lt;inline&gt;&gt;  to enter the example
    ![](images/lab01/img0240.png)

    *	**Copy** the following JSON sample into the editor
        ```javascript
		{
			"orgName": "Oracle Organization",
			"contactFirstName": "Chris",
			"contactLastName": "OConnnor",
			"contactEmail": "cc@hotd.ie",
			"country": "IE"
		}
        ```

    *	Click **OK**
    ![](images/lab01/img0250.png)

    *	Click **Next**
    ![](images/lab01/img0260.png)

-	In the Response-step:
    *	**Select JSON** as payload sample
    *	**Click** &lt;&lt;inline&gt;&gt; to enter the below example JSON
    ![](images/lab01/img0270.png)

    *	**Copy** the following JSON sample into the editor
        ```javascript
		{
			"orgid": "123",
			"status": "New Org Created"
		}
        ```

    *	Click **OK**
    ![](images/lab01/img0280.png)

-	Click **Next**
-	Click **Done**
-	**Save** the Integration

Your Integration should now look something like this:

![](images/lab01/img0290.png)


## **STEP 3.3:** Create the Integration - Check if Organization exists

Before creating a new organization, the first thing we will do is to check whether the organization already exists.
For this we will use the Service Cloud Connection.

-	**Drag and Drop** _your_ Service Cloud Connection (ServiceCloud-NN) after the Trigger *CreateOrgService*. Once you start to move the connector onto the canvas, you will see a plus-sign (+) just under the *CreateOrgService*. Drop the connector on this sign.

![](images/lab01/img0300.png)

-	**Configure** as follows
    * Name of endpoint: CheckIfOrgExists

-	Click **Next**

![](images/lab01/img0310.png)

-	**Configure** as follows
    * Select Operation mode: **Single** operation
    * Operation type: **ROQL** (ROQL is an SQL like query language for Service Cloud)
    
        + Select **Query objects** as Cloud Operation
	*	Enter the following query
        ```
		SELECT organization from organization where organization.name = '&orgName'
        ```

    * **Click** on Parameter Bindings
    * Enter **orgName**: Brindell
	* **Click** _Test My Query_
    
    
  
  ![](images/lab01/img0320.png)

You should have 1 result found, with a response that looks like this:

![](images/lab01/img0330.png)

-	Click **Next** and **Done** to close the Service Cloud connector
-	**Save** the Integration

Your integration now looks like this:

![](images/lab01/img0340.png)

Now we need to map the incoming *orgName* to the *CheckIfOrgExists* parameter.

-	**Hover** over, or click on the &quot;*Map to CheckIfOrgExists*&quot;, and **click** on the little pencil-icon to edit

![](images/lab01/img0350.png)

-	**Map** as follows
    * **Mark** orgName in the left column by clicking on it
    * **Mark** orgName in the right column by clicking on it
    * **Click** on &quot;Map&quot; to create the mapping
    * **OR** drag &amp; drop the source to target

  ![](images/lab01/img0360.png)

-	Click **Validate** and **Close**
-	**Save** the Integration

Your integration now looks like this:

![](images/lab01/img0370.png)

Now we will add a *Switch* action, which is essentially an if/else check.

If the Organization already exists, then we will return the *orgId* and a message – _&quot;Organization already exists&quot;._

If the Organization does not already exist, then we will create it and return the *orgId* and a message – _&quot;Organization created&quot;._

-	**Drag &amp; Drop** the **Switch** from the Actions Tab on the right and drop it right after *CheckIfOrgExists*

![](images/lab01/img0380.png)

![](images/lab01/img0390.png)


## **STEP 3.4:** Create the Integration - Case Organization exists

-	**Edit** path 1 by clicking on the pencil-icon:

![](images/lab01/img0400.png)

-	**Configure** as follows
    * **Expression name**: Org Already Exists
    * In the Expression-editor, **enter** : count()
    * Verify the condition is set to &quot;&gt;&quot;  and  &quot;0&quot; – greater than zero

  ![](images/lab01/img0410.png)

The Expression is now &quot;count() &gt; 0&quot;; but the count of what? Naturally, the count of the objects returned by *CheckIfOrgExists*. So we need to add this variable to the count().

-	**Drag &amp; Drop** Organization into the count()-expression ( **OR** mark and click  on the&quot;&gt;&quot;-icon)

![](images/lab01/img0420.png)

-	Click **Validate** and then **Close**
-	**Save** the Integration

If you hover over Route 1, you should see something like this:

![](images/lab01/img0430.png)

Now, in Path 1, we simply add a MAP to assign the return variable.

-	From the Actions-tab, **Drag &amp; Drop** a **Map** on the path just after &quot;Org Already Exists&quot;
-	**Map** as follows
    * id to orgId

  ![](images/lab01/img0440.png)

To manually set the status to a text – do as follows

-	**Right-Click** on the status element and select **Create Target Node**:

![](images/lab01/img0450.png)

-	**Switch** to *Developer View*:
![](images/lab01/img0455.png)

-	In the Expression aria at the bottom **enter** statement: "Organization already exists"
-	**Click** Save

![](images/lab01/img0460.png)

-	**Verify** the mapping

![](images/lab01/img0470.png)

-	Click **Validate** and then **Close**
-	**Save** the Integration

Your integration should now look like this:

![](images/lab01/img0480.png)


## **STEP 3.5:** Create the Integration - Case New Organization

Now to configure Path 2 – Otherwise

Here we will leverage the Service Cloud Connection to create an Organization in Service Cloud.

-	**Drag &amp; Drop** _your_ Service Cloud Connection (ServiceCloud-NN) onto Path 2.
-	Call the endpoint: CreateOrg; **Click** Next
-	**Configure** as follows
    * **Operation type**: CRUD &amp; Create
    * Search for Org, and **select** Business Object *Organization* by marking it and clicking on the &quot;&gt;&quot;-icon
    * **Click** Next
    * **Click** Done
-	**Save** the Integration

![](images/lab01/img0490.png)

Your integration should now look like this:

![](images/lab01/img0500.png)

-	Do the **Mapping** between *Otherwise* and *CreateOrg*

![](images/lab01/img0510.png)

-	**Configure** as follows
    * orgName to Name
-	Click **Validate** and **Close**
-	**Save** the Integration

![](images/lab01/img0520.png)

Your integration is almost done! Now, in Path 2, we just need to add a final MAP to assign the return variable.

![](images/lab01/img0530.png)

-	**Drag &amp; Drop** a **Map** Action into Path 2 after CreateOrg
-	**Configure** as follows
    * id to orgid

![](images/lab01/img0540.png)

To manually set the status to a text – do as follows

-	**Right-Click** on the status element and select **Create Target Node**:

![](images/lab01/img0550.png)

-	**Switch** to *Developer View*:
![](images/lab01/img0555.png)

-	In the Expression aria at the bottom **enter** statement: "Organization Created"
-	**Click** Save

![](images/lab01/img0560.png)

-	**Verify** the mapping

![](images/lab01/img0570.png)

-	Click **Validate** and then **Close**
-	**Save** the Integration

Your integration should now look something like this:

![](images/lab01/img0580.png)

All we need to do is delete the empty Map, just before the return

-	**Click** on the &quot;more&quot;-icon on the Map-action
-	**Click** Delete
-	**Save** the Integration

![](images/lab01/img0590.png)

The completed integration!

![](images/lab01/img0600.png)


## **STEP 3.6:** Create the Integration - Setup tracking

Before we activate and publish, we still need to set a tracking field, for auditing/monitoring purposes

-	From the &quot;more&quot;-menu in the upper-right corner, **click** Tracking

![](images/lab01/img0610.png)

-	**Configure** as follows
    * **Drag &amp; Drop** the orgName onto the Tracking Field

  ![](images/lab01/img0620.png)

-	**Save** and **Close** the Integration


## **STEP 4:** Activate the Integration

It&#39;s finally time to activate and publish your integration!

From the Integrations-list

-	**Identify** _your_ Integration – CreateServiceOrg-NN (you can search to filter the results)
-	Activate the Integration – **Activate** - by clicking on the turn on button

![](images/lab01/img0630.png)

-	Click **Activate**

![](images/lab01/img0641.png)


## **STEP 5:** Test using Postman

You will need to have Postman (or a similar program) installed for this step

-	Click on the **URL** from the activation notification to get the _REST Endpoint_

![](images/lab01/img0660.png)

You can also find that link here

![](images/lab01/img0670.png)

This directs to a very handy page, the Endpoint Description.
-	Copy the **Endpoint URL**
-	Copy the **Request sample**

![](images/lab01/img0680.png)

-	In Postman, open a **New Request**-tab
    * Enter the **Endpoint URL** you copied
    * Make sure you are using a **POST** -call
    * Under the tab **Authorization**
        + **Type**: Basic Auth
        + Enter your **OIC credentials**

  ![](images/lab01/img0690.png)

-	Click on the **Body** -tab
    * Choose **&quot;raw&quot;s**
    * Select **&quot;JSON(application/json)&quot;**
  
-	Enter the **request payload** you copied from the **Request sample** (similar to this)
    ```javascript
	{
		"orgName": "Oracle Organization", 
		"contactFirstName": "Chris",
		"contactLastName": "O'Connor",
		"contactEmail": "cc@hotd.ie",
		"country":"IE"
	}
    ```

    * **Modify** the orgName to: Oracle Organization **NN II** where **II** represent the initials of your name

-	Click **Send**
![](images/lab01/img0700.png)

-	You should have a Request-Response which looks like this:
![](images/lab01/img0710.png)

-	You can compare the Response to the example-Response from the Endpoint Description page.

-	Verify &quot;Organization Created&quot;

-	Click **Send** again
![](images/lab01/img0720.png)

-	Note the different Response
